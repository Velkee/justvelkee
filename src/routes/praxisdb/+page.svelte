	<h2>// About //</h2>
	<p>
		PraxisDB is a project I made to keep track of YFF praxis positions in companies. The project is
		currently not feature complete, and the website and API do not communicate yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I manage to finish the project, it may serve as a helpfull tool to those who are looking for
		a praxis position and teachers. A link to the projects's GitHub page is linked below.
