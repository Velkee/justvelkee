	<p>
		T.A.S.V. (Timed Automated Service Verifcator) is a bot I developed for a group of friends to
		help check if their Minecraft server was running, and to send a notification to the admin if the
		server was down.
	</p>
	<p>
		It didn't see much use and the bot isn't fully configurable (yet), but the code is still
		available on my GitHub.
